              The morning rain meant that a wet race was announced before the start, and most crews were faced with a choice: Use
              slicks or wet tires. Most competitors opted for the wet track, but pole driver Spinelli started the race on slicks
              and
              immediately paid the price. The No. 61 Huracan slid down to just 28th place as the

                Bonduel was ahead of Pro-Am runners Karol Basch (Micanek Motorsport) and Lewis Williamson (Oregon Team).Williamson
                was
                soon ahead of Basch for first place in Pro-Am and second overall, but the Oregon Team driver was not happy to stay
                in
                that spot, as he was taking some time away from Bonduel up front. Soon Williamson was behind Bonduel and made a
                decisive
                move in turn eight to grab the lead on lap seven. That was the pace of the No. 27 car, Williamson built a
                three-second
                lead and held the lead until pit stops.Bonduel, who was struggling with high tire pressure in the first stretch,
                switched to slicks on pit stops and took the lead again after overtaking Bromek Formanek, while the Target Racing
                car
                from Milan Teekens disputed third place with the Iron Dames car. Dorian Pin. The No. 83 Pin climbed to second
                place in
                front of Teekens after stopping, but came under pressure from Teekens at the end of the race. Teekens overtook Pin
                in
                the final laps and finished second after a Formanek spin two laps before the finish, while Pin also spun on the
                last lap
                to take fifth overall.Profiting from the spin
                Formanek, Siglia and Williamson finished third overall and first in Pro-Am, winning the title a race early. Benoit
                Semulen and François Semulen won the Lamborghini Cup class ahead of Van der Horst and Hans Fabri, while
                Lewandowski won
                the Am class.
